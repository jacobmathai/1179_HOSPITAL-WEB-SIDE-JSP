              <p style="color: black;" >It is often said that nothing happens, unless there is a dream first.
                  At the genesis of the Apollo story there was a dream.
                  A dream so powerful, that it helped transform the medical landscape in India.</p>
                      <p style="color: black;">The dream nurtured and grew within Dr. Prathap C Reddy, the founder Chairman of Apollo Hospitals, until the point of inflection happened in 1983. A young man succumbing to an ailing heart was what it took to ignite Dr. Reddy's vision into a reality - a vision where quality healthcare was given, where the pursuit of clinical excellence was daily endeavor, India a hub in the medical tourism map and where the Apollo family touches and enriches lives every minute, every day.</p>
                      <p style="color: black;">Today, with over 8500 beds across 51 hospitals, and a significant presence at every touch-point of the medical value chain, Apollo Hospitals is one of Asia's largest healthcare groups. Commenced as a 150 bed hospital, today the group has grown exponentially both in India and overseas. Its growth is often said to be synonymous with India emerging as a major hub in global healthcare.</p>
                      <p style="color: black;">Apollo Hospitals is driven by a single thrust, to provide the best standards of patient care. It is this passion that has lead to the development of unique centers of excellence across medical disciplines, within the Apollo Hospitals network. Apollo Hospitals has JCI accreditations for 8 of its hospitals, the largest by any hospital group in the region.</p>
                      <p style="color: black;">True to its founding principles, the group has made quality healthcare accessible to the people of India, and even overseas. It has become an institution of trust, and a beacon of hope to so many searching for a cure for their ailments.</p>
                      <p style="color: black;">The legacy of touching and enriching lives stems from the pillars of the Apollo philosophy - experience, excellence, expertise and research. We pride ourselves for constantly being on the cutting edge, and going the extra mile to stay relevant and revolutionary.</p>
                      <p style="color: black;">The Apollo Hospitals Group is the pioneer of integrated healthcare delivery in India. This vision led the group to earmark time and resources to strengthen each vital cog in the process of healthcare delivery. As a result of these efforts, the group today is in a unique position to exponentially increase its healthcare cover. This will be critical in order to meet future requirements.</p>
                      <p style="color: black;">Apollo Hospitals Group, today, is an integrated healthcare organization with owned and managed hospitals, diagnostic clinics, dispensing pharmacies and consultancy services. In addition, the group's service offerings include healthcare at the patient's doorstep, clinical & diagnostic services, medical business process outsourcing, third party administration services and health insurance. To enhance performance and service to customers, the company also makes available the services to support business, telemedicine services, education, training programs & research services and a host of other non-profit projects.</p>
